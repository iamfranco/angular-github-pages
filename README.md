# Deploy

After you've made some changes to the website, tested it locally and you want to deploy it onto GitHub Pages, run the command:

```
npm run deploy
```

This will build and deploy the website onto the `gh-pages` branch, which is the branch that GitHub Pages has been configured to build the website from.
